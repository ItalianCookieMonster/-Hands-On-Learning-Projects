<h1>Projects for Aspiring Web Developers</h1>
This repository originated from an idea within a Discord study group. We are a community of aspiring web developers who are enthusiastic about learning and challenging ourselves. Within our Discord group, we collaboratively select projects and set deadlines to complete them.

Please note that we are all beginners, and our projects are intentionally simple. They are ideal for individuals looking to practice and apply recently acquired skills.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
We primarily work with the following technologies (for now ðŸ˜‰):

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Objectives
Our objectives include:

<h2>Expanding our knowledge of web development</h2>
Practicing our coding skills
Understanding project deliverables and timelines as in real-world scenarios
Nurturing cooperation and teamwork
Enhancing our proficiency with Git and GitHub

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>
To contribute to our projects, follow these steps, especially if you are new to Git and GitHub:

Fork the Repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Clone Your Fork: Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following command to clone your fork to your local machine. Replace <your-username> with your actual GitHub username.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Projects-for-Web-Developers.git
Navigate to the Project: Use the cd command to move into the project directory. Replace <project-folder> with the project you're interested in.

bash
Copy code
cd Projects-for-Web-Developers/<project-folder>
Start Working: Create a new folder with your name and surname, followed by the project number, and begin working on your project. For example:

Copy code
John-Doe-p1/
Commit Your Changes: After making changes to your project, commit them locally. Use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
Push Your Changes: Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push
Create a Pull Request: Go to the original repository on GitHub (the one you forked from), and you should see a notification prompting you to create a pull request (PR). Follow the instructions to create the PR.

We welcome contributions and encourage you to join our community of learners!
